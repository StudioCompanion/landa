# Lane & Associates


This is a monorepo containing the Sanity CMS details and the frontend Sveltekit app for Lane & Associates.

To run, download this repo and run 
```yarn install```

To then run in development, run:
```yarn dev```

This can be easily deployed to vercel from the monorepo as it should recognise a sveltekit app. For those not familiar with Svelte, this page is the most useful for understanding the repo: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing
