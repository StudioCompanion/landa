# Lane & Associates


This is a monorepo containing the Sanity CMS details and the frontend Sveltekit app for Lane & Associates.

To run, download this repo and run 
```yarn install```

To then run in development, run:
```yarn dev```

This can be easily deployed to vercel from the monorepo as it should recognise a sveltekit app. For those not familiar with Svelte, [this page](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing) is the most useful for understanding the repo.

No `.env` file is currently required as all sanity configurates are hardcoded currently (as there is no seperate production/staging environment)
